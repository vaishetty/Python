#### Python Basics

The Python Interface:

In the Python script on the right, you can type Python code to solve the exercises. If you hit Run Code or Submit Answer, your python script (script.py) 
is executed and the output is shown in the IPython Shell. Submit Answer checks whether your submission is correct and gives you feedback. You can hit Run Code 
and Submit Answer as often as you want. If you're stuck, you can click Get Hint, and ultimately Get Solution.You can also use the IPython Shell interactively by 
simply typing commands and hitting Enter. When you work in the shell directly, your code will not be checked for correctness so it is a great way to experiment.

Instructions:

Experiment in the IPython Shell; type 5 / 8, for example.
Add another line of code to the Python script on the top-right (not in the Shell): print(7 + 10).
Hit Submit Answer to execute the Python script and receive feedback.

Answers:

#Example, do not modify!
print(5 / 8)

#Print the sum of 7 and 10
print(7 + 10)




When to use Python?
Python is a pretty versatile language. For which applications can you use Python?

Possible Answers

-For your new business, you want to develop a database-driven website.
-Your boss asks you to clean and analyze the results of the latest satisfaction survey.
-All of the above. (correct answer)



Any comments?

Something that Hugo didn't mention in his videos is that you can add comments to your Python scripts. Comments are important to make sure that you and others 
can understand what your code is about. To add comments to your Python script, you can use the # tag. These comments are not run as Python code, so they will not 
influence your result. As an example, take the comment in the editor, # Division; it is completely ignored during execution.

Above the print(7 + 10), add the comment

Answers:

# Division
print(5 / 8)

# Addition
print(7 + 10)




Python as a calculator:
Python is perfectly suited to do basic calculations. Apart from addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, there is also support for more advanced 
operations such as:
-Exponentiation: **. This operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right. For example 4**2 will give 16.
-Modulo: %. This operator returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on its right. For example 18 % 7 equals 4.
The code in the script gives some examples.

Instructions:

Suppose you have $100, which you can invest with a 10% return each year. After one year, it's  100 * 1.1 =110 dollars, and after two years it's 100 * 1.1 * 1.1 =121. 
Add code to calculate how much money you end up with after 7 years, and print the result.

Answer:

# Addition, subtraction
print(5 + 5)
print(5 - 5)

# Multiplication, division, modulo, and exponentiation
print(3 * 5)
print(10 / 2)
print(18 % 7)
print(4 ** 2)

# How much is your $100 worth after 7 years?
print(100 * 1.1 ** 7)
